<p 02><d 2923><a 02><n 55>
I've detected a
Biometal signature
in Area I.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2A23><a 02><n 55>
In addition to the
Biometal,
<--------------------->

there are other signs
of life in the area.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2B23><a 02><n 55>
It looks like some
innocent citizens are
<--------------------->

being held inside of
the facility.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2C23><a 02><n 55>
Head to Area I and free
the captives.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 2D23><a 02><n 04>
The life signs look
like they're located in
<--------------------->

the very back of the
area.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2E23><a 02><n 04>
Since you defeated the
one in charge of the
power plant operation,
<--------------------->

some of the equipment
isn't functioning now.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2F23><a 02><n 04>
If you could just find
a way to get the
electricity flowing...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3023><a 05><n 02>
Alright, I'll find some
way to get the power
back on.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 3123><a 1C><n 11>
Let me guess, you're
here to save the poor
folks in the next room?
<--------------------->

Quite the little
heroine aren't you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3223><a 1C><n 11>
They're valuable
sacrifices for the
<--------------------->

resurrection of
Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3323><a 1C><n 11>
Cyber-elves exposed to
data on fear are the
<--------------------->

key to reviving
Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3423><a 1C><n 11>
I am the Model H
Pseudoroid, Hurricaune!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3523><a 1C><n 11>
You're about to become
the next sacrifice.
<--------------------->

Just make sure to
scream for me!
<*********************>

<p 02><d 3623><a 1C><n 11>
Ahahaha! Your screams
were delightful!
<*********************>

<p 02><d 3723><a 1C><n 11>
Hah... Not bad... Do
whatever you want with
<--------------------->

the people in the next
room...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3823><a 1C><n 11>
It won't matter anyway.
Model W's awakening
<--------------------->

will still come to
pass! Ahahaha!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 3923><a 33><n 07>
It looks like you've
recovered the password
and my power.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 3A23><a 33><n 07>
I am grateful. However,
it will take time to
reassemble the password
<--------------------->

into something you can
use.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 3B23><a 33><n 07>
Please be patient.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 3C23><a 02><n 04>
The people are in
that room. You have
to free them.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 3D23><a 46><n 41>
W-we're saved!!!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 3E23><a 46><n 41>
We were just about to
become Cyber-elves!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 3F23><a 46><n 41>
Thank you for rescuing
us!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 4023><a 05><n 02>
You were going to
"become" Cyber-elves?
What do you mean?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 4123><a 46><n 41>
Those bad guys, they
steal our memories and
<--------------------->

change us into
Cyber-elves.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 4223><a 46><n 41>
They were also trying
to scare us before
we changed.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 4323><a 46><n 41>
I saw them... I saw the
others changing
<--------------------->

one-by-one into those
Cyber-elves.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 4423><a 02><n 04>
So that's how they were
able to create so many
of them...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 4523><a 02><n 04>
They're even crueler
than I had imagined.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 4623><a 02><n 04>
We'll send the people
back to town. Thank you
for saving them, Aile.
