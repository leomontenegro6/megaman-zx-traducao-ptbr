<p 02><d 411F><a 02><n 55>
The radar is picking up
a Biometal signature.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 421F><a 02><n 55>
It's on the move and
has entered Area H on
its own.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 431F><a 02><n 55>
Area H is where the
amusement park was
<--------------------->

attacked in a Maverick
raid ten years ago.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 441F><a 02><n 55>
It's abandoned, but it
seems as though some of
<--------------------->

the machinery is still
in operation.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 451F><a 02><n 55>
Head to Area H and
secure the Biometal.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 461F><a 02><n 04>
Aile! Mavericks are
concentrating in that
area!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 471F><a 02><n 04>
It looks like they're
after the Biometal too,
so be careful!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 481F><a 08><n 02>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 491F><a 02><n 04>
Aile? Did you hear me?
What's wrong?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 4A1F><a 05><n 02>
Oh! I'm okay. I'm going
to proceed with the
mission now.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 4B1F><a 08><n 02>
I can't believe I have
to fight here...
<*********************>

<p 02><d 4C1F><a 07><n 02>
Hmm, this isn't the one
with the Biometal.
<--------------------->

I wonder where it could
be?
<*********************>

<p 02><d 4D1F><a 02><n 04>
Aile, what's going on?
<--------------------->

You've been acting
strange ever since this
mission started.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 4E1F><a 07><n 02>
Prairie, can you tell
me where that Biometal
signature is coming
<--------------------->

from!? Just hurry up
and tell me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 4F1F><a 02><n 04>
Aile, calm down! What's
going on with you?
<*********************>

<p 02><d 501F><a 08><n 02>
Ten years ago I was
attacked by the
Mavericks...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 511F><a 08><n 02>
I was separated from my
mom during the panic,
<--------------------->

and Giro is the one
that found and rescued
me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 521F><a 02><n 04>
You were there ten
years ago during the
Maverick raid...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 531F><a 08><n 02>
This place has a lot of
memories for me, both
good and bad.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 541F><a 08><n 02>
I just don't want
anything to happen to
those memories.
<--------------------->

I want them to stay
the way they are.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 551F><a 02><n 04>
Now I understand. I'm
sorry, I...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 561F><a 05><n 02>
No, I'm sorry. I was
getting all worked up
<--------------------->

with the memories of my
mom and Giro flooding
back.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 571F><a 02><n 04>
Aile, please remember
that you are never
alone.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 581F><a 02><n 04>
You've got me and the
other Guardians...
<--------------------->

And you've got Giro
watching over you too.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 591F><a 02><n 04>
We'll save this country
together.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 5A1F><a 05><n 02>
Thank you Prairie.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 5B1F><a 06><n 02>
Recommencing mission!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 5C1F><a 1D><n 12>
Ook! Ook! So a
Maverick has come to
take me back eh?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 5D1F><a 1D><n 12>
Lord Serpent just
doesn't understand how
to treat his employees!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 5E1F><a 07><n 02>
So you're the one with
the Biometal!
<--------------------->

I'm sorry but I'll be
taking it now.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 5F1F><a 1D><n 12>
Oh, so you're not one
of the Mavericks? Then
get out of my park!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 601F><a 07><n 02>
I'm the one with the
memories here. You get
out of my park!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 611F><a 1D><n 12>
Ook? You aren't
actually going to
challenge an
<--------------------->

officer of Slither Inc.
are you? This should be
interesting.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 631F><a 1D><n 12>
I'll show you just how
powerful the Pseudoroid
Purprill really is!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 641F><a 1D><n 12>
Ook! Ook! That'll teach
you to interrupt me
<--------------------->

with nonsense about
memories.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 651F><a 1D><n 12>
I'm an executive
officer!
<--------------------->

Did you really think
I'd be done in by the
likes of you?
<*********************>

<p 03><d 661F><a 1D><n 12>
N-nooo! I'm too
powerful to be beaten!
I'm an... officer...
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 671F><a 1D><n 12>
I should be...
unstoppable... Ooook!!!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 681F><a 36><n 0A>
Drowning in his own
power...
<--------------------->

What an appropriate end
for a low-life that
wanted it so badly.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 691F><a 36><n 0A>
I am the Biometal of
the Shadows, Model P.
You fought bravely.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 6A1F><a 36><n 0A>
Model X, since you are
lending your power to
<--------------------->

this one, am I to
assume the time has
come?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 6B1F><a 31><n 05>
It has. Someone is
trying to revive
Model W.
<--------------------->

Will you help us stop
him?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 6C1F><a 36><n 0A>
It is our destiny
across the ages to
<--------------------->

protect the world of
Man.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 6D1F><a 36><n 0A>
Let us once again
become humanity's blade
for striking down evil.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 6E1F><a 36><n 0A>
I apologize that I
cannot hand over the
password.
<--------------------->

Serpent split my data
up into two parts.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 6F1F><a 36><n 0A>
The other part is
contained in a
different Pseudoroid.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 701F><a 36><n 0A>
As long as that
Pseudoroid is
<--------------------->

operational, you will
never reach Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 711F><a 05><n 02>
I better stay alert if
there's another enemy
<--------------------->

out there with the
power of Model P.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 461F><a 02><n 04>
Aile! Mavericks are
concentrating in that
area!
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><d 471F><a 02><n 04>
It looks like they're
after the Biometal too,
so be careful!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 481F><a 05><n 02>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 491F><a 02><n 04>
Aile? Did you hear me?
What's wrong?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 4A1F><a 05><n 02>
Oh! I'm okay. I'm going
to proceed with the
mission now.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 4B1F><a 05><n 02>
I can't believe I have
to fight here...
