<p 02><d B90B><a 02><n 55>
There's a trial you
need to pass in order
to obtain permission
<--------------------->

to enter Guardian HQ.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BA0B><a 02><n 55>
There are undercover
Guardians hiding among
<--------------------->

the inhabitants of
Area C.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BB0B><a 02><n 55>
Locate them and bring
back proof that you
passed the trial.
<*********************>

<p 02><d BC0B><a 02><n 04>
Hold on. It looks like
Slither Inc.'s security
<--------------------->

force is starting to
patrol the area.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BD0B><a 05><n 02>
Patrols? That's the
first time I've ever
<--------------------->

heard of them doing
those.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BE0B><a 02><n 04>
Slither Inc. must have
already heard about the
Maverick attack.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BF0B><a 02><n 04>
If you stay
transformed, they might
think you're in
<--------------------->

league with the
Mavericks and attack
you on sight.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C00B><a 02><n 04>
I'm sure the people
around town will also
find it hard to
<--------------------->

approach you if you
look like that.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C10B><a 02><n 04>
In any case, it's too
dangerous to walk
<--------------------->

around town
transformed. Be
careful.
<*********************>

<p 02><d C20B><a 23><n 2E>
You're going to
undertake the trial for
<--------------------->

permission to enter HQ
right?
<*********************>

<p 02><d C30B><a 23><n 2E>
There are four
Guardians like me
hidden throughout town.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C40B><a 23><n 2E>
If you can find all of
us, you pass the test.
<*********************>

<p 02><d C50B><a 23><n 2E>
Let the trial begin!
Good luck!
<*********************>

<p 02><d C60B><a 24><n 28>
Hoho! I shoulda known
I'd get spotted in this
hiding place.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C70B><a 24><n 28>
You aren't gonna catch
my comrades so easily
though.
<--------------------->

They're in places that
require more than just
strolling on in.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C80B><a 24><n 28>
Press the +Control Pad
diagonally down to
crouch while walking.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C90B><a 24><n 28>
Look around different
places, you never know
what you might find.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d CA0B><a 24><n 28>
I'm heading back to HQ.
Good luck with the rest
of the trial!
<*********************>

<p 02><d CB0B><a 25><n 19>
Oh, looks like you
found me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d CC0B><a 25><n 19>
You should be careful
of the security
patrols.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d CD0B><a 25><n 19>
As long as they're
giving you the green
light,
<--------------------->

you're safe from
attack.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d CE0B><a 25><n 19>
But if you're caught
with a weapon they will
open fire,
<--------------------->

no questions asked!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d CF0B><a 25><n 19>
Anyway, I'm heading
back to HQ. Good luck
with the trial!
<*********************>

<p 02><d D00B><a 2B><n 1F>
Yikes!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D10B><a 2B><n 1F>
Oh! You finally found
me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D20B><a 2B><n 1F>
I was afraid of running
into the security force
and getting hurt.
<--------------------->

<d D30B><a 2B><n 1F>
That's why I've been
hiding here.
<--------------------->

<d D40B><a 2B><n 1F>
*phew* I thought they
would find me for sure.
<--------------------->

Now I can finally head
back to HQ.
<*********************>

<p 02><d D50B><a 2C><n 20>
Grahaha! Well done
findin' me little miss!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D60B><a 2C><n 20>
I wish we had more of
your kind in the
Guardians.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D70B><a 2C><n 20>
But whether you decide
to join us or not is up
to you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D80B><a 2C><n 20>
I'll be headin' back.
See ya later!
<*********************>

<p 02><d D90B><a 02><n 04>
It looks like you found
them all.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DA0B><a 02><n 04>
Head to Area C-2 and
get the certification
for passing the test.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DB0B><a 02><n 04>
That will conclude your
trial.
<*********************>

<p 02><d DC0B><a 23><n 2E>
You passed the test.
Here, take this.
<*********************>

<p 03><d DD0B><a 05><n 02>
A stuffed animal?
*giggle*
<--------------------->

It's really cute, but
is this supposed to be
my certification!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DE0B><a 23><n 2E>
You better take care of
that.
<--------------------->

It's one of Prairie's
most prized
possessions.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DF0B><a 23><n 2E>
Anyway, that concludes
your trial.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d E00B><a 23><n 2E>
There's a transerver in
the room behind me.
<*********************>

<p 02><d E10B><a 23><n 2E>
Don't forget to file a
mission report!
