<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
*sigh* I'm worried
sick...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
My son has been
skipping his lessons
lately...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
He comes home so late
everyday, it has me
concerned.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I hope he hasn't fallen
in with a bad crowd.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I'm so worried... Could
you do me a favor and
go check on him?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
He's been coming home
late ever since the
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
fire incident.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I just don't know what
could be causing it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
What on earth could he
be up to?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
Find the young boy 
near the site where the
fire broke out.
<*********************>

<e 01><a 02><n 55>
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
You haven't found him
yet, have you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I'm worried sick, you
have to hurry and find
him!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
He's my little
treasure.
<--------------------->

If you find him for me,
I'll make sure you're
rewarded.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
3!
2!
1!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
0!
Here I come!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Woah! You scared me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Are you hiding too,
miss?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Oh, is it time to go
home already?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
I can't yet! I have to
find everyone!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Huh!? Are you going
to help me find them?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Wow, thanks! Alright,
I'll give you a hint.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
The guy that was the
seeker last time is no
good at hiding.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
He's probably on a
floor not too far from
here.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Thanks for the help!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
Ah shoot! Ya found me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
Why is everyone better
at hiding than me?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
Hey miss, are you
looking for the others?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
Need a hint?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
The hardest things to
find are right over
your nose.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Dang, ya found me!
Hey, where's everyone
else?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
You're lookin' for one
of us?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
There's one really
quiet guy.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
He's probably hidin' in
a corner somewhere.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
...Hm?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
I'm hiding.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
Hey, don't bother me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
This place is great for
hiding. It's so dark.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
What do you want!?
You're gonna give me
away! Scram!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
Whatever... Just make
sure you find the other
guy.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
I don't like him very
much.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
He's the new guy, but
he's already the best
at hiding.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
My cousin Bonbon was
making fun of me for
playing kids' games.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
But that's beside the
point.
<--------------------->

The new guy stole my
place as the number one
hider!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
You're going to have to
try really hard if you
hope to find him.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
Nooo! How could anyone
find this prime hide
and seek real estate?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
Wait, I don't know you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
Oh, mom asked you to
come and find me, huh?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
I never knew playing
with friends could be
this much fun.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
Whenever I get home
from school,
<--------------------->

I've got nothing but
homework waiting for
me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
I know mom is only
looking out for my
future,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
but I don't want to
think about my future
right now.
<--------------------->

I'm just a kid, you
know?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
Would you believe that
it's harder to hide
well in hide
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
and seek than to score
100 percent on a test
in school?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
I'm gonna do what I
wanna do from now on!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
...But then again, I
don't want mom to be
sad either.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
I'll go home now and
tell her how I feel.
<--------------------->

Thanks for coming to
fetch me.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
My son is back...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
He was such a good kid,
I don't know what
happened...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
This is the first time
I've ever had to punish
him.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
It must be that crowd
he hangs out with.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
Thank you for bringing
him home.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I've sent a little
something to the
transerver for you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
Quest completed.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
400 EC have been
transferred to your
account.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I hope you found the
amount I transferred
enough.
<--------------------->

Thank you so much
for your help
finding my boy.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I talked things over
with my son and it was
the first time
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I've heard him talk
like that.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
It was just one crazy
thing after another.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
Never let anyone say
being a parent is easy!
