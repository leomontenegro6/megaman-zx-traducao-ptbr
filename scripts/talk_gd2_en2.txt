<#####################>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
You're the little girl
from before.
<--------------------->

Congratulations on
passing the test.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
Me? Oh, I'm Oeillet.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
We met in town earlier.
Don't tell me you
already forgot me...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
Let me tell you a
little more about the
transerver.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
There are actually two
different models of
transervers.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
One model has mission
data, data management
<--------------------->

and transport
functionality.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
The other model is
missing the transport
feature.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
They look very similar,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
but if you want to get
somewhere fast,
<--------------------->

you'll need that
transport feature.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
For taking on new
missions and quests or
filing reports,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
any transerver will do.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
Are you okay!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
You looked like you
were upset when you
left earlier,
<--------------------->

so I was worried.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
You're a lot tougher
than you look.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
I wasn't expecting you
to be so strong!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
I'm sure Prairie is
glad to have you with
us.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
We'll be relying on you
in the future, so don't
let us down!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
What a shock...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
We're so lucky you were
around to help us repel
that attack.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
We couldn't have done
it without you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
I was sure we were all
goners.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
I'm glad HQ is still in
one piece.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
If we had crashed, we
could have hurt a lot
<--------------------->

of people in the town
below.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
I know I'm a Guardian
and I shouldn't rely on
others,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
but if Slither Inc. has
secured Model W,
<--------------------->

I have to accept that
there's nothing I
can do.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
We don't have any
weapons powerful enough
to fight back...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
We're going to have
to rely on you now
more than ever.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
I hope you'll lend us
your strength.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
Thank you for your help
earlier.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
I've never met a girl
as brave as you before.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
It looks like your
clothes got a little
dirty.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
I know you just came
out of a battle,
<--------------------->

but you should always
look your best!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
I check the mirror ten
times a day just to
<--------------------->

make sure I'm
beautiful.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
It doesn't matter how
many times I look,
<--------------------->

I'm still captivated by
my loveliness.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
I was stunned when I
saw all of those enemy
<--------------------->

ships appear from
behind the clouds!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
I thought that would be
the end of us all.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
Guardian HQ wasn't
meant to be a
battleship.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
It's amazing it took
out as many enemy ships
as it did!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
We even made sure to
get clean hits to avoid
<--------------------->

raining debris down on
the town below.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
This ship is no slouch.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
I knew if anyone could
take down all of the
Pseudoroids,
<--------------------->

it was you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
After all, you were
chosen by Model X
right?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
Are you prepared for
the tough road ahead?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
The coming fight is
going to be a true
test of will.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
You should do what you
can to prepare
yourself.
<--------------------->

Make sure your Biometal
is repaired!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
Really... You shouldn't
wear the same clothes
everyday!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
Would you like me to
come up with an outfit
for you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><m><a 24><n 29>
  Sure, thanks!
  No, that's okay
  I like the blue
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
I knew you'd see it my
way!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
How do you like this?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
Okay fine, be that way.
What a shame...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
I guess I can
understand. We all have
our favorite outfits...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
Hello! You are <nome>,
correct?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
My name is Cédre.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
You are quite
attractive, but nothing
compared to my beauty.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
You would give Prairie
a run for her money
though.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
What do you think of
this lovely rocket
launcher?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I am assigned to HQ, so
I rarely get a chance
to use it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I wish I could go out
and show my skill to
the world.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
Are you okay <nome>? Poor
thing...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
You did your best
little girl.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I am always on the side
of a fighting woman.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I meant to ask you,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
are you still doing the
transporter work while
fighting Mavericks?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
That is amazing! Wait
until everyone hears
about this.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I am at a loss...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I could never have
imagined this kind of
thing happening to HQ.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I stayed put in another
room on Prairie's
orders,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
but I wanted to fight
alongside you!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I could have at least
taken down some of the
little guys.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I do not care what the
people think of
Serpent,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I think he is pathetic
and I hate pathetic
people.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
<nome>, I know you will
take Serpent out for
us!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
Hello <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
Is that equipment
enough?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
This is a valuable
antique of mine, would
you like it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
It is called an E Tank.
<--------------------->

It will restore all of
your health.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
I may be a nice person,
but I am not that nice.
<--------------------->

I want something in
return.
<--------------------->

<p 02><e 01><a 27><n 1B>
How about 200 EC?  
  Alright...
  No way!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
You will not regret it!
Here you go, use it
well!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 27><n 1B>
You do not even have
200 EC!
<*********************>

<p 02><s 01><a 27><n 1B>
You are awfully sure of
yourself... I guess
it is your life.
<*********************>

<p 02><s 01><a 24><n 2A>
You're the girl that
saved me from the fire
right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
I have you to thank for
my life then.
<*********************>

<p 02><s 01><a 24><n 2A>
I wish there were more
brave girls like you in
the Guardians.
<--------------------->

<p 02><s 02><a 24><n 2A>
We definitely
appreciate your
presence here.
<--------------------->

<p 02><s 03><a 24><n 2A>
The guys around here
are not very useful
when we're in a pinch.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
But they're all a good
bunch of people.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
Look at this place...
Even the handrail is
gone...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
It's going to take a
lot of time and money
to fix it all.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
The ship is looking
pretty bad.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
Silure says it'll hold
together enough to
fly...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
but it appears its
fighting days are over.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
Excellent work <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
You're the one that has
to decide how best to
<--------------------->

use the power of the
six Biometal fragments.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
I think you can
overcome any situation.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
You have so far, right?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
I'm amazed. You were
the chosen one for
Model X.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
Meeting you feels like
fate.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
We're tracking the
other Biometal
signatures down.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
Leave it to the three
Operators. They'll find
them!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
Be careful <nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
I don't know what I
would do if something
happened to you...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 0C><n 04>
I can't believe this
happened.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0C><n 04>
I was too naive...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
You can see how hard
they hit us just by
<--------------------->

walking across the
deck.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
I can't let myself get
emotional.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
If Sis was here...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
She would be strong.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 09><n 04>
Thank you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 09><n 04>
We've only come this
far with your help.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 09><n 04>
The rest is in your
hands.
<--------------------->

We're placing our faith
in you and the
Biometal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 09><n 04>
Please... Please come
back to us, okay?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 0B><n 04>
<nome>, please! You have
to protect the ship!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
You're the one they
call <nome>, right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
I'm Muguet and I'm the
doctor here.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
I hope you don't mind
if I ask for your help.
We just don't have the
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
manpower and everyone
else tries to help out
where they can.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Remarkable...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
You came out of that
with nothing more than
a few scrapes.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
It seems that the
Biometal makes you more
resistant to injury.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
This could have serious
implications for modern
medicine.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Oh, I see... It only
works for the chosen
one...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Unbelievable!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
When HQ was rocking
around,
<--------------------->

I fell and ended up
hurting myself.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
I have to take care of
the wounded before I
<--------------------->

can even think about my
own wounds though.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
They just keep
coming in...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Keep it up <nome>!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
There's nothing you
can't do!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
We're behind you all
the way!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
H-hello <nome>.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
My name is Rose.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
Lately, I've been too
busy, but I used to
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
stop by the town once
in awhile.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
Anyway, I hope we can
help each other out in
the future.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
I was really worried
about you <nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
I saw you run out of HQ
earlier,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
and I had a bad feeling
in the pit of my
stomach.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
You're very lucky <nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
Even with the Biometal,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
most people wouldn't
have survived what you
did.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
Your parents gave you
life, make sure you
value it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
The one I loved was
attacked by
Mavericks...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
He didn't make it... He
suffered for two days,
and then it was over.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
That's what made me
want to go into this
line of work.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
Oh... I said too much.
Please don't tell
anyone, okay?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
A-are you okay <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
I-I...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
I was so worried, I
thought my mind would
melt down on me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
I know I worry too
much...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
If I can't take care of
myself, how can I take
care of other people?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
It feels like the
patients just never
stop coming in...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
Even while I'm thinking
about it,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
someone somewhere is
struggling for life.
<--------------------->

I just wish I knew what
to do.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
I'm not sure if it's
because of the
Biometal,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
but you look so much
stronger than before.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
You look so grown up
now <nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2E><n 22>
I know you're a girl,
but something about you
reminds me of him...
<*********************>
