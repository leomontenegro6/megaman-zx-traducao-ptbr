<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Are you the
transporter, <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
My name's Hareng.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
It's too early to tell
you my real name.
<--------------------->

Consider Hareng more
of a codename.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Hmm...
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
It's hard to believe
that a kid is the
chosen one for Model X.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I can't believe it.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
<nome>, you're alive!
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Even with the help of
the Biometal, that's
impressive!
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I'm glad you're safe.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Don't go overboard!
Leave some action for
the rest of us.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I would never have
imagined they would
<--------------------->

launch an assault
directly on HQ.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I guess we're not safe
even way up in the sky.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
If only I could have
been a chosen one...
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I would have given the
enemy a run for their
money.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I wonder how chosen
ones get chosen in the
first place.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Things aren't looking
good <nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
We now know the danger
behind Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Whatever we do, we must
stop their plans from
being carried out!
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
When we first met, I
couldn't believe you
were the chosen one.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
But now I realize
there's a good reason
you were chosen.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I have faith in you
<nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Stop Serpent's blind
ambition before it's
too late!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
You're <nome>, the chosen
one for Model X!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Does it feel different
now that you have the
Biometal?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Maybe I'm too curious
for my own good.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Oh, I'm sorry. I
haven't introduced
myself yet.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I'm a mechanic.
The name's Anguille!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I work for Silure. He's
the older mechanic
around here.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I've still got a lot to
learn before I'm as
good as him.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I may need to ask you
for help someday <nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Thanks in advance for
any help you can
provide!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
You're alive <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I'm so happy! I never
thought I would see you
again!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
You're not a ghost are
you? I just can't
believe you're okay.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
<nome>, you must live on
and continue where Giro
left off...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I know how you must
feel, but try to be
strong...
<--------------------->

I know he's watching
over you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I was worried that was
the end of the
Guardians.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
HQ was not designed to
be a battleship. We
almost bit it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I hate to think what
would've happened if
you weren't here...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
HQ would probably have
slammed into the earth,
<--------------------->

turning the city below
into an inferno.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Serpent has to pay for
everything he's done!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Even now, everyone
thinks he is a hero!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
<nome>...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Save the people of this
country from Serpent...
Don't let him get away.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Don't let Slither Inc.
dig up the Model W
Core!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
The world will never
survive if they get
their hands on it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
You're the only one
that can put a stop to
Serpent <nome>!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
Thanks for before.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I'm happy you passed
the test.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
My name is Carrelet.
I'm tidying up the
warehouse today.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
It's not in the job
description, but I do
what I can.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I wonder if Anguille is
ever going to finish my
chip...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I gave him everything
he needed to work on it
half a year ago.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
He doesn't seem to care
very much about being
timely with things...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You're alive!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I know the Biometal
helped, but you did the
rest.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
Humans are capable of
things that can't be
explained by science.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
They're incredible.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
Oh yeah.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You can take on
missions and quests
from any transerver.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
It's probably more
convenient to take on a
request near the
<--------------------->

location of the
mission.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
How are you doing?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You did great
protecting this ship.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You passed the test,
and then you saved us
all.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
But there will be more
tests on the road
ahead.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
It seems as if several
Pseudoroids are
<--------------------->

standing guard in the
Outlands.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You already know that
the areas are divided
into several blocks.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
But you won't be able
to tell if a Pseudoroid
<--------------------->

is in the block or not
until you enter it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
Any Pseudoroids that
have regenerated can be
<--------------------->

seen from the map
though.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
If the block is
blinking red,
<--------------------->

then you know they have
regenerated.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You've come a long way.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I never would have
guessed you could make
<--------------------->

it this far fighting
alone.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I have something to
tell you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
Anguille finally
finished the chip I
requested.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
It's called an Eraser
Chip, and it allows you
<--------------------->

to destroy enemy shots
with your saber.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You could put it to
better use than I ever
could. Please take it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
Yikes! Who are you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
Oh, you're the boy that
saved me in town
earlier.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
Thank you so much for
your help.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I was a goner until you
came along.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
Sorry, I never properly
introduced myself. My
name is Congre.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I really have no idea
why I'm working here...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
Oh! It's you... You
shouldn't sneak up on a
guy like that...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
How are you holding up?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
It was a million to one
shot you could survive
an attack like that.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
If it was me, I
wouldn't be the one in
a million...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
You're brave beyond
your years.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
*phew* I was so
scared...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
This is the first time
the enemy has ever been
<--------------------->

bold enough to attack
HQ.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
We're so high up in the
air, we never expected
an attack.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I'm holing up in my
room for awhile.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I'm not sure if it's
safe to go out yet or
not.
<--------------------->

They might come back...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I knew you had it in
you,
<--------------------->

but I never imagined
you were that good.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I wish I had even just
1% of your courage...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I know there's nothing
I can do for you,
<--------------------->

but I'll still keep on
rooting for you!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
What's your name
mister?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Ooh, I see. Your name
is <nome>, huh?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
My name's Sardine.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
No one ever wants to
play with me,
<--------------------->

so I always have to
play by myself.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Old Silure made me this
toy...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
But it's all busted up.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I wish he would fix it
for me.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Are you okay <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I don't want you to get
hurt! Please be
careful.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
If you get hurt, we
won't be able to play
anymore...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I can't lose another
friend...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Will you be my friend
forever and ever <nome>?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I've never seen the
enemy attack us like
that before.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
But I wasn't scared!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I knew you would come
and save us <nome>!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
With you around, I can
be brave too!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I want to protect
everyone when
I grow up!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Get Serpent for me,
okay <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
You're our only hope!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
If peace is back,
Silure might be able to
make me another toy!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
This toy is called
Little Moby.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Silure's made me other
toys, but...
<--------------------->

*whisper* They weren't
that fun...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
One toy looked like an
oven with legs...
<--------------------->

It was too weird to
play with.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Don't tell Old Silure
though, he'll just get
sad.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Why hello there. Aren't
you <nome> from Giro
Express?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
My name is Silure.
Pleased to meet you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I can't believe these
old eyes. You're the
Biometal's chosen one.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
You're a bit...
different than I
expected.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I love wiling away the
hours fiddling with
machines...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
But there's not much
space for fixin',
<--------------------->

so I sometimes borrow
Fleuve's lab.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
He seems to be working
on something important
in there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Bless my soul, you're
alive <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I was so worried about
you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
By the way...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I heard that Slither
Inc. has begun work on
<--------------------->

using Biometal to
design Reploids.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Fleuve told me about
them and was calling
them Pseudoroids.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I'm guessing that all
of the incidents that
keep popping up in the
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Outlands have something
to do with the
Pseudoroid experiments.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Pseudoroid Biometal is
very fragile.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
That means that Slither
Inc.'s technology for
working with Biometal
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
is still far from
perfect.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Some Slither Inc.
Reploids and
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Mechaniloids have the
ability to regenerate.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
That might be one power
inherent in the Model W
fragment.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
It sends a shiver down
these old bones just
thinking about it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Ah, you're okay.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I wasn't sure how much
longer this old ship
would last.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I'm glad I finished
reinforcing her
yesterday...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
But she won't hold
together through
another battle.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
The deck area has taken
the worst of it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
And I just don't have
time to fix it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
We'll just have to keep
running her as-is and
hope for the best.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
We've come a long way.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
The final battle lies
ahead <nome>.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
This old man is in your
corner!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Who are you? This is
the first time I've
seen you around.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Ah... Hold on...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
You're the guy that had
to bring back the
stuffed animal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Just don't get cocky
kid.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
You're a transporter,
right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
You should know finding
a stuffed animal is a
test for children.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I guess I might as well
introduce myself.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
The name's Scombrésoce.
You're probably
thinking it's long eh?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
What's your name?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Hmm, <nome> eh?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I'm not sure how much a
little kid can do, but
hey, give it your best.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
You were Model X's
chosen one and still
<--------------------->

got whooped by
Serpent's lackeys?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Yeah, good luck with
the big cheese.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Giro gave his life for
you too, right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Why would he go and do
that?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Hey <nome>, I've got
something to tell you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
There's an area in the
Outlands that gives off
powerful signals.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
They mess with your
senses so that left and
right are backwards and
<--------------------->

sometimes you can't
even fire your weapon.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Not to worry though. If
you have some smelling
salts,
<--------------------->

you'll stay clear in
the head.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I'll sell you some for
20 EC.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Who'd have thought
they'd have the nerve
to attack HQ?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I guess even
guys like me have to
fight sometimes.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
*sigh* What a hassle.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I wonder if this ship
will crash into the
ground.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
*sigh* That'd be a
shame.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Not bad for a kid.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
The Biometal helps, but
it didn't do everything
you know.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
It looks like the rest
is up to you <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
We won't be able to do
anything for you in
the coming battle.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
What is it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><e 01><a 29><n 1D>
Need smelling salts?  
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Better safe than sorry
eh?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Just remember that it
won't work if you use
<--------------------->

them while getting hit
with the signal that
scrambles your senses.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I'd love to give you
more, but I only had
the one pack on me.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
If you want some, you
better pay up. That'll
be 20 EC!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
No? You mean I just
did all that talking
for nothing!?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
Thank you for your help
<nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
My name's Sole.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
My clothes still smell
like smoke.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
It's a shame we had to
meet under such
circumstances.
<--------------------->

You only get one
chance at a good first
impression...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
I was surprised by
everything that
happened.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
I really wish it was
all just a bad dream.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
It's a good thing the
HQ warehouse was
reinforced.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
Normally things are
kept as thin and light
<--------------------->

as possible to make
flying easier.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
I know I'm not the one
that has to fight
Serpent.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
But I'm still so
nervous.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
Whatever you do <nome>,
make sure Serpent is
stopped!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
You're the only one who
can do it!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
Hey! I'm glad to see
you passed the test.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
My name's Dorado.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
It seems like there are
more and more Mavericks
in the Outlands lately.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
The situation has
gotten to the point
<--------------------->

where we can't protect
people anymore.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
Now that you're here...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I hope that we can do
something about them.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I can't believe it...
Are you okay now?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
How you can still be
standing after taking a
hit like that,
<--------------------->

I have no idea.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
It must be the power of
the Biometal.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I went to town
yesterday for the first
time in ages,
<--------------------->

but it was too big and
I just got lost.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I'm so stubborn, I
didn't check my map.
<--------------------->

Don't make the same
mistake.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
Press START to open the
sub-menu then choose
Mission.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
You can see the
connection with other
<--------------------->

areas and your current
location.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
You weren't hurt, were
you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
The ship was shaking so
much, I fell right on
my butt.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I'm still not in great
shape, but I can't just
sit around.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
Did you find out what's
behind Model W?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
There are so many
rumors flying around
lately,
<--------------------->

I don't know what's
real and what isn't.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
No one but you can
stand up to Slither
Inc.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I'm sorry that I can't
be more helpful to
you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Oh! Sorry, did you want
to talk to me?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Who are you anyway?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
<nome>. Got it!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
My name's Truite.
People have a lot of
trouble remembering it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Wait!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Your name is <nome>. That
means YOU'RE the chosen
one for Model X!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Wow! How did you become
the chosen one?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Is there some kind of
Mr. Chosen One Contest
being held?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
You're a transporter,
aren't you <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I might need your help
someday.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Actually...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Hmm... never mind. I
won't bother you with
it now.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Oh, I didn't know you
were talking to me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
How's your body holding
up?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
All the Biometal in the
world won't help if you
get mortally wounded.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Hm? You still need to
talk to me about
something?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I'm a little busy at
the moment.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
That was a big
earthquake just now,
wasn't it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Huh? It wasn't an
earthquake?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
HQ is a flying airship
you say!?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I didn't even notice we
were under attack.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Goes to show how
oblivious I am.
<--------------------->

I'm glad everyone else
is on top of things.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Are you looking for
Model W?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Here I thought you were
just working the
<--------------------->

Guardian HQ branch for
the transporters.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I didn't know you were
entrusted with such a
heavy burden.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I just figured you were
the chosen one of the
day for Model X.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Hey there boy! It looks
like ya passed the
test.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I guess that means
you're one of us now!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I'm sorry. I haven't
introduced myself.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
The name's Thon. Short,
but sweet.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Your name is <nome>?
Don't mind me if I
forget.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Hey boy! Ya doin'
okay?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
It's a real miracle
you're back with us,
safe an' sound.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I know I'm not Giro,
but if ya need
anythin', just ask.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
It always feels like
the world is okay when
you're up in the sky.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
But every time ya look
down from the clouds,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
ya see the world the
Mavericks are makin'.
<--------------------->

By takin' on Slither
Inc.,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
we're effectively
takin' on the whole
country.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
We better give it
everythin' we've got,
or we're toast.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I never woulda figured
we had a chance.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
This ship barely held
together under that
powerful barrage.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Who knows when they'll
come after us again...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I'm sure Prairie will
do whatever she can to
avoid another fight.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
We can't just sit
around lickin' our
wounds.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
We should take the
fight right to Slither
Inc., eh boy?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
You found the six
Biometal fragments.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
After comin' this far,
there's no turnin' back
now.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Trust in yourself an'
do what needs to be
done boy!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
When I first saw you
in town, I didn't think
ya were more than a
<--------------------->

boy.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
But now I think
there's nothin' ya
can't handle.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
What's the matter? Ya
look worried.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Don't forget that
you're not alone.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
You've got six
Biometal fragments
backin' ya up too.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Hey <nome>! My name's
Bar.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Thanks for saving me
earlier.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Muguet already patched
up the injury that the
<--------------------->

snake Mechaniloid gave
me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Muguet's a real pro,
but she nags a bit too
much for my taste.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Rose is gentle and shy,
so she's more my type.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Maquereau hurt his leg
in the battle. I wonder
how he's doing.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
I have some advice for
you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Try not to transform
around town.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Mavericks wandering in
from the Outlands,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
or security
Mechaniloids will sense
the weapon you hold,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
and attack on sight.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
People around town will
be nervous around you
because of the danger.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
There might come a time
when you'll have no
choice, but be careful.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
<nome>, you had us all
worried sick.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
I know how you feel
about not wanting to
stand around.
<--------------------->

But try to take it
easy.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Oh yeah.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
I found something out
about the Reploids
known as Pseudoroids.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
They possess the
ability to regenerate
themselves.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
If left alone, they'll
come back to life
automatically.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
It looks like that's
one of the things
Slither Inc. was
<--------------------->

researching behind the
scenes.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
People don't know any
better and treat
<--------------------->

Serpent like some
national hero.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Oh, did you already
know all of that?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Are you okay <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
The Guardians were okay
thanks to the room
security systems.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
We got hit pretty hard.
<--------------------->

Thank the lucky stars
no one was seriously
injured.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Well, actually we
should be thanking you
for that.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
So you've found the six
Biometal fragments
now?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Now all that's left is
for you to harness the
power of the Biometal.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Oh yeah!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
I found this chip when
I was patrolling the
forest earlier.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
With it, your body
won't sink or break
<--------------------->

through fragile
surfaces.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
I don't go to the
Outlands, so I won't be
needing it.
<--------------------->

You should take it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Yes <nome>, what is it?
<*********************>

<p 02><m><a 22><n 18>
  Check Database
  Talk
  Nothing
<*********************>

<p 02><m><a 22><n 18>
  Repair Biometal
  Check Database
  Talk
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
There are a lot of us
Guardians around the
ship.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
If you have time,
perhaps you should say
hello to everyone.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
The Guardians can be
strange sometimes, but
they're good people.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Try not to get angry
and just hear them out.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
<nome>! Are you alright!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I know you want to get
back into action,
<--------------------->

but you need to learn
to control the
Biometal.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Take it easy and master
the power of the
Biometal.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I'm shocked.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I would never have
expected us to show up
on the enemy's radar.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
We must change our
flight plans to avoid
detection again.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I'll contact the
Operators and let them
chart us a new course.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I've got something
interesting to tell you
<nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Did you know that each
Biometal fragment has
been divided into two
<--------------------->

pieces and split
across two different
Pseudoroids?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
If you can find both
parts,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
you will have access to
two varieties of charge
<--------------------->

attacks for each
model.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
The usage differs
according to the model.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
For Models HX, LX and
PX, you charge up to a
second level and then
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
press +Control Pad up
while releasing the
attack button to fire.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
For Model FX, charge it
up to the second level
and then press
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
+Control Pad down while
releasing the attack
button to fire.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
At last! You've
collected the six
Biometal fragments.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Our future is now in
your hands <nome>.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
You're the only one
with the power to save
us...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
We have faith in you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Oh yes, <nome>...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Please take this with
you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
This chip will cut your
weapon's charging time
down.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
It used to belong to
another Guardian,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
and it took time to
synchronize it with
your Biometal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I just finished it a
little while ago.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
You'll need to file
your mission report
<--------------------->

before I can repair
your Biometal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Please file it at the
transerver and then
come back then.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
<nome>! I have excellent
news!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
About the strange stone
you found in Area N-1,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I think I may have
figured something out.
Could I have a look?
<*********************>

<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
All done! This turns
out to be a special
variety of Biometal!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
It has a very funny
glow to it, but you
<--------------------->

should be able to use
it to transform.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
I feel so pathetic.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
I tried to rescue
everyone from the fire,
<--------------------->

but ended up needing
rescuing myself.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
I'm glad you came along
when you did.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
Thank you so much for
your help.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
I shudder to imagine
what would've happened
<--------------------->

if you didn't arrive
when you did.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
We were in a big pinch.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
Your moves were
incredible as you wiped
<--------------------->

enemy after enemy off
of our ship.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
Slither Inc. grows more
powerful with each
passing second.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
We have to find the
rest of the Biometal...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
If we don't, this world
is as good as
Serpent's.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
Thanks to you, it feels
like the Guardians
stand a chance.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
I hope we aren't
holding you back. It
feels like there's not
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
much we can do for you
now.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
Hi <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
That lava was pretty
scary, wasn't it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
Did you happen to find
the switch for
controlling its flow?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
It feels like you keep
turning up just when I
need help.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
First, you saved me
from that snake
Mechaniloid.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
Then you saved me from
the burning building.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
If you weren't around,
I'd be as good as gone.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
Thank you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
I was worried about you
<nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
The ship was rocking so
much, I thought a
meteor hit us.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
You didn't get hurt,
did you <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
I'm still wounded, so
I've been resting here.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
Are those the six
Biometal fragments
you've got there?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
They're amazing.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
Incredible technology
must be behind the
Biometal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
It's hard to believe it
was made centuries
ago...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
Dude! You're <nome>,
aren't you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
I'm Morue, and it's so
cool to meet you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
Did you get a chance to
meet everyone in HQ?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
They're all good
people, you should
totally chat it up.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
It looks like that road
in Area D-1 is still
outta commission.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
At least it does the
trick for keeping out
Mavericks on foot.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
The switch in front
activates with a quick
attack.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
You might be able to
continue down the
road now.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
You had me worried
<nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
I thought you got
wasted. I was so
totally about to mourn.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
It's awesome that
you're okay!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
You might already know
this,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
but you can only take
on one mission or quest
at a time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
If you want to ditch
one for another,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
you have to cancel the
current one.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
That means everything
you've done so far is
for nothing though,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
so you'll have to start
from scratch when you
try it again.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
I almost wet my pants
when I saw all those
ships surrounding us.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
You're one brave dude
<nome>!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
Those are the six
Biometal fragments?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
It's like they're
totally all harmonizing
with each other.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
Just don't let those
Slither Inc. dudes get
a hold of Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
This world is so gonna
be wasted if they get a
hold of it!
