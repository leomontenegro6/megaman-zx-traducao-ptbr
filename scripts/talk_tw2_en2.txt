<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
If you go a little
further to the right
down this road,
<--------------------->

you'll see a door
leading to a
transerver.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
The other door in the
room leads to the
highway.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
The highway is within
Innerpeace, but there
have been a lot of
<--------------------->

Mavericks showing up
there lately.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
That's why mommy always
says I shouldn't go
there.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
You have to use the
highway to reach the
buildings in Area G.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I need to go there to
buy pet food or my poor
pets will go hungry.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I really love going on
walks in the forest. I
do it every day!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I was planning to go
there again today too.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
But lately, so many bad
Mechaniloids have been
showing up even in
<--------------------->

Innerpeace that I'm a
little scared.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I know Innerpeace is
supposed to be safe,
but I'm still worried.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
My doggy's name is
Canis.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
He's a very good boy.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
He always finds
mushrooms for me when
we go to the woods.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Mommy's happy to have
him around too since it
saves on groceries!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 57><n 54>
Woof woof!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I have a lot of pets!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I've got an anteater, a
lemur, a chameleon and
a piranha!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I enjoy taking Canis
out for our little
walks,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
but he always sits down
on the way and won't
budge.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
As soon as it's
lunchtime though, he
comes to life.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
You're too smart for
your own good...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 57><n 54>
Woof!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Canis just learned how
to shake hands.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I wonder what I should
teach him next...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Yikes! Who are you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Canis is nervous around
strangers, so please
don't come any closer!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 57><n 54>
Rrr...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
You're already working?
At your age?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
That's amazing! I don't
envy the tough work you
must be doing.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I've never seen a
transporter delivering
things on foot though.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
Work is important, but
you should study too!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
It'll be too late to
go back and study
when you grow up.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
Did you see it!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
See what you say? The
flash in the sky just
now...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I could've sworn that I
heard a rumble too,
like thunder.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
The weather forecast
didn't call for any
storms today though...
<--------------------->

Must just be my
imagination.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I've heard that here in
the Outlands,
<--------------------->

a lot of Mavericks are
running around.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
But I don't see what
the big deal is.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
If there's a problem,
Slither Inc. will take
care of it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I'm so busy nowadays...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I've got a lot on my
mind with my son's
future and all.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
As a mom,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I would love to see him
work for Slither Inc.
someday!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
Lately Slither Inc.
seems to be really busy
too.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
I've seen a lot of them
heading into the cave.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 53><n 4E>
...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
Thank you for before,
ma'am!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
I was just out shopping
when the fire started.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
I saw the fire getting
closer and closer. I
was so scared!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
I want to forget about
the fire.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
My legs tremble when I
even think about
leaving my house.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
Even the feeling of
heat scares me,
<--------------------->

so I can't bake my
favorite cookies
anymore...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
If I can't bake my
world famous cookies,
<--------------------->

how am I going to make
friends?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
Will you be my friend
even if I can't make
cookies?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
Hmm...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
We could play make
believe. Just pretend I
baked cookies!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
*sigh* Bored, bored,
bored.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
I just want to go
outside and play...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
It's so hard to enter
and leave this room.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
Whoever made this
building must have been
a little nutso.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
I want to move to a
bigger house!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
A giant palace with
four kitchens and
four living rooms!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
Have I seen you before?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
Hmm, I must be thinking
of someone else.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
Oh! You're the woman
that saved all of us
<--------------------->

when we were being held
in that room.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
I knew it was you! 
Even though you look a
bit different now...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
I'm sorry I never got
to thank you for what
you did.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
Hey! You're a
transporter? Wow,
that's cool!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
I didn't know
transporters rescued
hostages too...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
You're like some kind
of super hero!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
I was scared, being
trapped in that dark
room...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
The boy that was with
me was scared too. He
cried the whole time.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
We were both imagining
the worst.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
I never thought I would
feel the sunshine
again.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
At night when it's
dark,
<--------------------->

I sometimes remember
how scary it was in
that room...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
I can't sleep with the
lights off yet.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
Hey.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
Do you have any ideas
for helping me get over
my fear of the dark?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
If I count one more
sheep, I'm gonna
scream.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
Hey Transporter!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
Take this!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
It's your birthday
today, isn't it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
I'd like to say I made
it all by myself from
scratch,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
but my sister helped me
with most of it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
You're the one that
rescued me earlier...
Aren't you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 41><n 3C>
If my mom catches
me talking to you with
that costume on,
<--------------------->

she'll get mad at me.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
Thank you for rescuing
me from that fire.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
My leg injury is not as
bad as I thought it
would be.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
I would never have
expected that area to
come under attack.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
It used to be part of
Innerpeace...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
What to do now...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
My favorite store was
in that building.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
Why am I worrying?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
Slither Inc. will just
build an even better
building in its place!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
I guess in the meantime
I'll just shop around
here.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
It's just a residential
area though, so the
shopping's not so hot.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
Does Giro Express
even deliver to the
Outlands?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
That sounds dangerous!
Be careful out there!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
You poor child. Being
forced to handle such
risky business.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
What kind of person
would let a child do
all their dirty work?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
Who... Or what are you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
And what's with the
Halloween costume? Just
leave me alone please!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
Oh, you...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
You're the one that
saved us from the
<--------------------->

burning building,
aren't you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
It has to be you! I
couldn't get a good
<--------------------->

look with all of the
smoke,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
but I remember your
voice clear as day!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
I'm very good at
remembering voices!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
Thanks to you, I'm
doing fine.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
The doctor said I
should keep off my feet
as much as possible.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
I had a lot of plans,
like going out on dates
and shopping,
<--------------------->

but those are all out
the window now.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
I was in the building
looking for a present
for my boyfriend.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
My parents are dead set
against our
relationship.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
Do you have someone
special in your life?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
Even if I have to
run away, I want to
marry the man I love.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
I realized how
important love is when
I almost lost my life.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
I have to live life the
way I want to, not the
way others want me to!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
I know mom and dad are
just looking out for
me,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
but I'm an adult now
and they can't tell me
what to do.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
They need to back off
and let me be me.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
I finally introduced my
boyfriend to my
parents.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
They saw how much he
cares and have backed
off a little bit.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
I knew it the moment I
saw him.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
Our love is so pure,
nothing and no one can
ever come between us!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
Wha-!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
Don't come near me with
that weirdo outfit!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
Oh, I see. You're a
transporter for Giro
Express.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
You were dressed
differently last time I
saw you.
<--------------------->

I barely recognized
you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
I was whisked away by
some weasel monster and
held captive.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
Thank you so much for
saving me!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
Are you trying out a
new Giro Express
uniform or something?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
It's a cool outfit, but
others around town
might not think so.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
They might think you're
one of those Outland
Mavericks.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
The Slither Inc.
security patrols might
try to attack you too.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
I know you saved me,
but even I am a little
nervous talking to you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
The weather's great
today!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
Whenever it rains, I
think back to that
day...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
I had a nightmare about
that weasel monster
last night...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
I want to put the past
behind me and return to
<--------------------->

the days when I could
be more carefree.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
I know he doesn't look
it, but that guy Robert
<--------------------->

over there was an
athlete.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
He used to be really
big into soccer.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
I should know... He
never stops talking
about his glory days.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
It's hard to talk to
you when you look like
that...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
There might be a
security guard watching
us.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 4D>
Could you go back to
looking like a normal
person for me?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
You're the one that
saved me from the
<--------------------->

confinement facility
earlier, aren't you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
I didn't realize you
were a woman at the
time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
You're really brave to
head into that scary
area all alone!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
It seems like the
power was out in part
of the facility.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
I guess the power from
the plant got cut off
somehow.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
It was pitch black and
all of the conveyor
machinery stopped.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
It's great weather
today. Why am I hearing
thunder!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
It sounded like a big
sound came from over
there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
You might want to be
careful until we know
what it is.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
My kid thinks that a
battleship fell from
the sky!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
Hmph. Kids...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
Don't worry about me,
I'm fine.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
But it does kind of
concern me that nothing
<--------------------->

about this is making
headlines.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
Something that big
should be all over the
news by now!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
There must be a good
reason for keeping it
quiet.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 44>
Who are you? Wait...
Aren't you the one that
saved me?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
I'm happy that this
country has come so far
<--------------------->

with the help of
Slither Inc.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
But I wish they would
work on adding more
greenery to the city.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
I love flowers!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
I love flowers more
than anything.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
Just one look and
that's all it takes to
<--------------------->

soothe a troubled
heart.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
I want to open my own
flower shop someday.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
Spending all of my
working day surrounded
by beautiful flowers
<--------------------->

would be a dream come
true.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
What do you think gives
flowers their beauty?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
I think it's because
they're so delicate and
fleeting.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
Like chasing something
that always remains
just out of reach.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
It's a lot like love.
The passion is here
today, gone tomorrow.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
I must be attracted to
things that don't last
forever.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
Weren't you just
walking on the guard
rail?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
I thought transporters
were sticklers for
following the rules...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
There aren't many
flowers growing in this
area.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
It's kind of sad
without any.
<--------------------->

I wish Slither Inc.
would plant some around
town.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
Do you have something
you want to discuss
with me?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4A><n 45>
If you want to talk,
you're going to have to
ditch the crazy outfit.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
I love this place...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
Doesn't it feel
wonderful to sit next
<--------------------->

to the fountain and
listen to the water?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
I always come here to
relax when things
aren't going my way.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
On some days, they shut
off the water to do
repairs or cleaning.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
There's nothing sadder
than seeing a fountain
without water.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
Did you know that in
Winter, this fountain
freezes over?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
I'm not sure why, but
frozen fountains still
help me to relax.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
I haven't felt like
going out much lately,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
but I always make sure
I come here once a day.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
Have you ever been to
the power plant on the
<--------------------->

other side of that
fountain?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
Apparently Area I is
beyond the plant, but
I've never been there.

When I was young, the
snowy mountains and
<--------------------->

lake were part of
Innerpeace.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
I used to go there with
my family to see the
Aurora. *sigh*
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
The Outlands are slowly
swallowing up
Innerpeace.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
I'm sure Slither Inc.
has some sort of plan
in place though.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
W-who are you!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
Don't scare a girl like
that!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
I recognize that
uniform...
<--------------------->

You're from Giro
Express aren't you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
I'm always calling on
you guys when I send
<--------------------->

packages to my aunt in
the next town over.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
I remember a long
haired guy with a red
outfit.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
I haven't seen him
lately though. Is he
on vacation?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
Did you know that there
are red switches around
town?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
They're set up so that
an impact on the switch
<--------------------->

will open a nearby
door.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
What could possibly be
hiding behind such
protected doors?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
Mavericks are always
causing trouble in the
Outlands.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
But we don't get that
kind of trouble here in
Innerpeace.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
This ideal lifestyle is
possible thanks to
Slither Inc.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
You should thank your
lucky stars they're
around.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
I come from a long line
of bakers.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
My grandpa would love
to open a bakery again
someday.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
For me personally, I'd
rather open something
other than a bakery.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
Maybe even a candy
store.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
My great great great
great great great
grandfather
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
used to work in a
village bakery.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
He learned his secret
recipe for baking
delicious bread from an
<--------------------->

old Reploid...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
Baking must be in my
family's genes.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
Everyone loves our
bread so much,
<--------------------->

sometimes it's hard to
keep up with demand.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
Would you like to try
some? It's fresh from
the oven!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
I can't possibly eat it
all, so go ahead and
have some.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 54><n 4F>
I'm sorry, I can't talk
to you...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Excuse me, are you a
transporter with Giro
Express?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
I saw you earlier when
I was out shopping with
mother.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
You always wear the
same thing.
<--------------------->

You should buy some
new, cute outfits!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Do you like this?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Mother bought this
pochette for me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
This is all the rage
among girls around my
age.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
The color pink is not
well suited for girls
<--------------------->

growing closer to
adulthood though...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
But then again, doing
something slightly
<--------------------->

outside the norm can be
fashionable too.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
I want to be a fashion
model someday.
<--------------------->

<p 02><e 01><a 43><n 3E>
What do you think?  
  You can do it!
  No way!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Aww, that is sweet of
you to say.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
When I grow up...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
I want to wear a pretty
dress and dance at a
<--------------------->

fancy Slither Inc.
ball.
<*********************>

<p 02><s 01><a 43><n 3E>
Hmph! Well I never!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
You really know how to
dash a little girl's
dreams.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Don't you think my
fashion is ahead of the
times?
<--------------------->

<p 02><e 02><a 43><n 3E>
Well?
  Yes
  No
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
I see you have quite a
bit of fashion sense
yourself.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
The stitches on the
skirt frills are the
latest thing.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
It's something that the
big clothing companies
can't copy.
<*********************>

<p 02><s 02><a 43><n 3E>
You think they're
just ordinary!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
You're one to talk!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
You should take a look
in the mirror sometime.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Slither Inc. is
searching for models.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Mother and father
are quite opposed to my
dreams.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
But if they hear it's
Slither Inc. looking
for models,
<--------------------->

they couldn't possibly
be opposed.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Slither Inc. is where
the future is at.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
If Slither Inc. ever
went out of business,
<--------------------->

this country would be
in trouble!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
I almost forgot!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
If you'd like, I could
give you some cool
clothes!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
I'll pick something
that suits you
perfectly!
<--------------------->

What do you think?
<--------------------->

<p 02><m><a 43><n 3E>
  Different is good
  I'm fine as I am
  I like blue
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
How about this one? I
think it's totally you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
It's the same brand I'm
wearing now.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Just wear it with
pride. The brand has an
image to maintain.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Ignoring the
fashion advice of a
future model...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Pft, whatever. It's
your life...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
You like blue, huh?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
You have to try new
things. Fashion is
<--------------------->

about challenging the
norms.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Eww! What's with that
outfit!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 43><n 3E>
Is that the big fashion
somewhere else?
