<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
What wonderful timing!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
We're on the verge of
running out of aid kits
again.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Could you spare some
time to bring me
another one?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Whatever you can find
might be enough to save
a life.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
As you know, Area L
is a big Maverick
stockpile.
<--------------------->

You might find
something there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
Bring back an aid kit
from the enemy supply
container.
<*********************>

<e 01><a 02><n 55>
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
You still haven't found
the medical supplies
yet, have you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
I'll help the wounded
as long as I can, but
we need supplies.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Magnificent work, dear!
You brought the
supplies!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
You're a little angel.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
I know Rose is amazed
by all of your efforts
to help.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
We may run low again.
If we do, I'll be sure
to ask for your help.
